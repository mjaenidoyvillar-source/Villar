# Stuff'd Inventory Management System

## Project Title
**Stuff'd Inventory Management System**  
*A comprehensive Laravel-based inventory tracking and transaction management system*

---

## Description / Overview

Stuff'd is a full-featured inventory management system built with Laravel PHP framework. This system allows businesses to efficiently manage their product catalog, track inventory levels, process sales transactions, and monitor business performance through an intuitive web-based dashboard.

The system implements a two-phase transaction process (create â†’ complete) to ensure data integrity and prevent stock discrepancies. It features real-time stock tracking, customer relationship management, and comprehensive business analytics.

**Key Highlights:**
- **CRUD Operations** for Products, Categories, Transactions, and Customers
- **Smart Stock Management** with automatic status indicators (In Stock, Low Stock, Out of Stock)
- **Transaction Workflow** with pending â†’ completed status tracking
- **Data Integrity Protection** prevents deletion of customers with transaction history
- **Business Analytics** with financial calculations and inventory metrics
- **Responsive UI** using Bootstrap 5 and Font Awesome icons

    $table->id();
    $table->string('name');
    $table->integer('quantity');
    $table->decimal('price', 8, 2);

           ->default('pending');
    $table->text('notes')->nullable();
    $table->timestamps();
});
```

### Product Model

```php
class Product extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = [
        'name',
        'quantity',
        'price',
        'category_id',
    ];

    public function hasStock($quantity)
    {
        return $this->quantity >= $quantity;
    }

    public function reduceStock($quantity)
    {
        if ($this->hasStock($quantity)) {
            $this->quantity -= $quantity;
            $this->save();
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Transaction Controller

```php
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $request->validate([
        'buyer_id' => 'required|exists:buyers,id',
        'product_id' => 'required|exists:products,id',
        'quantity_purchased' => 'required|integer|min:1',
    ]);

    $product = Product::findOrFail($request->product_id);
    
    if (!$product->hasStock($request->quantity_purchased)) {
        return back()->withErrors([
            'quantity_purchased' => 'Insufficient stock. Available: ' . $product->quantity
        ])->withInput();
    }

    $transaction = Transaction::create([
        'buyer_id' => $request->buyer_id,
        'product_id' => $request->product_id,
        'quantity_purchased' => $request->quantity_purchased,
        'unit_price' => $product->price,
        'total_amount' => $product->price * $request->quantity_purchased,
        'status' => 'pending',

    return redirect()->route('transactions.show', $transaction)
        ->with('success', 'Transaction created successfully.');
}
```

### Database Relationships

```
Categories (1) â”€â”€< Products (n)
